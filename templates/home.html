                <p>
                    The function of a kidney is to filter wastes and excess fluids 
                    from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. Chronic
                    kidney diseases also known as Chronic Kidney failure which describes the
                    gradual loss of the kidney. According to a survery conducted in 2017, India
                    was ranked 6th in the world for prevalence rates for Chronic Kidney Diseases 
                    across the globe.
                </p>
                <h2>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF KIDNEY DISEASES?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chronic Kidney Disease</li>
                    <p>It's the most common form of kidney disease. It is a long term condition and 
                        chances of improvement are very less and is mainly caused by high bloof pressure and diabetes.
                    </p>
                    <li>Kidney stones</li>
                    <p>Kidney stones are another common problem that occurs when minerals and other substances
                        in the blood crystallize forming solid stone like masses. They usually come out of the 
                        body during urination and it's very painful.
                    </p>
                    <li>Glomerulonephritis</li>
                    <p>Glomerulonephritis is an inflammation of the glomeruli. Glomeruli are extremely small structures inside the kidneys that filter the blood. Glomerulonephritis can be caused by infections, drugs, or congenital abnormalities (disorders that occur during or shortly after birth). It often gets better on its own.</p>
                    <li>Polycystic kidney disease</li>
                    <p>Polycystic kidney disease is a genetic disorder that causes numerous cysts (small sacs of fluid) to grow in the kidneys. These cysts can interfere with kidney function and cause kidney failure. (Itâ€™s important to note that individual kidney cysts are fairly common and almost always harmless. Polycystic kidney disease is a separate, more serious condition).</p>
                    <li>Urinary tract infections</li>
                    <p>Urinary tract infections are bacterial infections of any part of the urinary system. Infections in the bladder and urethra are the most common. They are easily treatable and rarely lead to more health problems. However, if left untreated, these infections can spread to the kidneys and cause kidney failure.</p>
